This is the repo for my MSc project in computer science for which I have achieved a destinction.

Abstract:
This report describes the design and implementation of a cycling route analysis system. The system consists of a simple modular design architecture with a risk modelling component as well as a route analysis and visualisation component. The risk vectors include traffic accident risk and exposure to air-pollution. The traffic accident risk model involved the implementation of a snap to line algorithm in combination with proximity analysis. The air-pollution risk model involved the implementation of a spatial interpolation algorithm. Route analysis includes distance measurement, slope gradient and exposure to risk. The system also includes dynamic, interactive cartographic visualisations. The development work was done using the Geotools GIS development libraries in combination with the Java programming language.
